            <p>If you are a lover of music, it is impossible for you to listen to only one genre or only one type of music. As a music lover myself, one of the genres that I love the most is Argentinian rock. It is so different from rock in other countries, and it has amazing musicians. Also, the lyrics on the songs are poetic and can trigger different emotions on everyone depending on how you perceive it.
                This genre has a lot of empowerment in the songs, as it emerged from repression and a dictatorship. Rock was banned in Argentina for some time but that could not kill the need for the country to express themselves through music.

            <h3>Some history</h3>
            <p>Rock and roll first began to appear in Argentina in 1956 after the genre was created in the United States in 1954-1955, based largely on rhythm and blues and country and western. Elvis Presley and Bill Haley (who visited Argentina in 1958) awakened the interest of several Argentine artists. The most notable among Argentine garage bands which sprung up in this period was Sandro y Los de Fuego, who recorded a successful series of Spanish language covers of American rock and roll hits and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular internationally. Others include Eddie Pequenino, Los Cinco Latinos and Billy Cafaro.
                The first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands. In 1964, Argentina, like much of the rest of the world, was shaken by The Beatles phenomenon.
                There was a development unique to Argentina which may help to explain, in retrospect, why the country would become a very important rock music-producing nation. Historians describe a parallel pattern of development with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming Bluegrass and Country in the US, in Argentina Folklore and Pampas music. Country music is an important pillar of Rock & Roll. In Argentina folklore (at that time Nueva canci√≥n was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s.
